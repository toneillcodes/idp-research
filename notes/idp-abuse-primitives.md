# IdP Abuse Primitives
## Introduction
An **abuse primitive** (often used interchangeably with attack primitive) refers to a basic, **foundational attack technique** that leverages an existing, **legitimate feature, configuration setting, or design mechanism** of a system in an **unintended, malicious way**.  

It's a discrete atomic action that exploits how a system is designed to work, rather than a bug or vulnerability in its code.  

Attackers chain these primitives together to form an attack path to achieve a larger goal, such as privilege escalation or gaining persistence.  

In this portion of my research, I am exploring primitives within modern IdP platforms.
